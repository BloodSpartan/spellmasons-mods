# Spellmasons Mods
## Getting Started
The [Spellmasons Mods Youtube Series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrNoNMIiNc_E7L-n4GGboHXQJq-cP2Cs1) explains how to mod Spellmasons (I'm in the process of adding more videos).

You'll need a basic working knowledge of Typescript and Git to mod Spellmasons.

To get your changes running in game, run `npm run build` then 
    if you're developing off of the Spellmasons repo: copy the entire folder into `Spellmasons/public/spellmasons-mods`
    if you're just modifying your Steam Spellmasons's local files: copy the entire fold into `steamapps\common\Spellmasons\resources\app\src\build\spellmasons-mods`
