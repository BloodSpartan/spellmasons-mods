# Spellmasons Mods
## Getting Started
The [Spellmasons Mods Youtube Series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrNoNMIiNc_E7L-n4GGboHXQJq-cP2Cs1) explains how to mod Spellmasons (I'm in the process of adding more videos).

You'll need a basic working knowledge of Typescript and Git to mod Spellmasons.
